## SECTION 1: EXECUTION OF BOM, SOW, NTP, PO, INVOICING, CO’s & COP’s

### BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM) & SCOPE OF WORK (SOW)
*   **Creation**: Engineering Vendor creates BOM/SOW in Sitetracker. Line items initiated by Engineering Vendor, reviewed by TFC QC Design Engineer.
*   **Template**: Vendors must select the correct template for the Job Type.
*   **Approvals**: Engineering Vendor submits -> TFC QC Design Engineer reviews and approves.
*   **Common Mistakes**: BOM totals not matching Design Drawings; Incorrect Microduct/conduit counts; Incorrect Material scoping; Lacking detailed summary on front page of Design Drawings.

### NOTICE TO PROCEED (NTP)
*   **Definition**: Official authorization for the construction vendor to begin work. Issued only after "Release to Construction" (RTC) status.
*   **Process**: Construction Project Coordinator (PC) assembles NTP package (Design, BOM, Permits, ABF). Zips and uploads to Sitetracker Files. Notifies Vendor.
*   **Timeline**: Vendor must access NTP package and submit Purchase Order (PO) request in Sitetracker within **3 days**.
*   **Construction Window**: NTP actualization triggers the **45-day** construction timeline.
*   **Package Contents**: Permits, Construction Design (CD), BOM, As-Built Fiber (ABF).

### PURCHASE ORDERS (PO) & INVOICING
*   **PO Process**: Vendor receives NTP -> Vendor submits PO in Sitetracker (within 3 days) -> Vendor approves PO.
*   **Invoicing Phase 1**: Vendor completes Phase 1 construction -> Requests QC Inspection -> Passes QC -> Submits Phase 1 Invoice (within 2 days of QC).
*   **Invoicing Phase 2**: Vendor completes Phase 2 -> Requests QC -> Uploads Closeout Package (COP) -> Submits Phase 2 Invoice (within 5 days of completion).
*   **Approval**: Construction PM reviews and approves invoices. Finance team validates integration to NetSuite.
*   **True Up**: Like-for-like adjustments (variance ≤ 5%). Vendor submits True Up BOM/SOW -> PM approves -> System generates PO -> Vendor submits Invoice.
*   **Change Order (CO)**: Scope additions or changes > 5%. Vendor submits CO Request Form -> Senior CM approves -> Vendor initiates PO/Invoice.

### CLOSE OUT PACKAGE (COP)
*   **Importance**: Final proof project is built to standard. Required for payment.
*   **Submission**: Vendor uploads COP to Sitetracker Files (Category: 'Closeout').
*   **Naming Convention**: 'Job Number_Document Name_COP'
*   **Critical Step**: Vendor MUST actualize the "Closeout Package Submission" date in Sitetracker. Without this date, the project will not move to payment.
*   **Required Documentation**:
    1.  **Redlines (As-Builts)**: Final marked-up drawings. Must show correct conduit footage, GIS locations (decimal format) for all assets (FX4, Vaults, Toby boxes, etc.), sequential fiber footage, cable manufacturer, offsets from EOP/BOC.
    2.  **Bore Logs**: Records of all bores. Must include Start Point, Footage, Depth, Offsets, Handhole # and Stationing.
    3.  **Photos**: Before/After photos of area, FX4 (pad, conduits, placement), Vaults (open/closed, gravel, ground rod, locate wire, splice case, coil, marker ball), Toby Boxes (open/closed).
    4.  **ABF Verification Form**: Hexatronic form completed in Excel. Must match photo addresses.
    5.  **BOM**: Actual materials used.
    6.  **Splice Results**: OTDR and ILM test results (PDF) + splice case photos.
    7.  **Tillman QC Sign-Off**: Signed TFC Construction Compliance Checklist.
    8.  **GPS As-Builts**: 1-foot accuracy.
    9.  **Permits/Inspections**: Copies of all permits and closed inspections.

### TIMELINES & SLAs
*   **Construction Start**: Within 30 days of NTP.
*   **Restoration**: 7-Day Restoration Policy (Mandatory). Complete restoration within 7 days of project completion.
*   **COP Submission**: Within 5 days of restoration completion.
*   **QC Inspection Request**: Within 2 business days of phase completion.
*   **Invoice Review**: 2 days for PM review.

    *   Walk wheeled by both supervisors and inspectors.
    *   Completed page by page.
    *   Document ALL DAP locations.
    *   **Photos**: Wheel at 0 (start) and wheel at end measurement using Timestamp App.
    *   **Deliverable**: Updated red line maps with correct footage, uploaded to "Walked out As-builts Maps" folder (project-specific subfolder).
*   **Daily Inspection Checklist**:
    *   **Safety**: Traffic cones, warning signs, PPE, safe parking, hazard check.
    *   **Procedure**: Locates verified, video of entire job, "Before" photos, permits accessible, utilities potholed, pits verified at 3' depth.
    *   **Redline**: Morning meeting, 10AM report, Toby boxes checked (2-way access/trace wire), DAP placement verified.
    *   **QC & Restoration**: Drills use plywood, job briefing, site cleanup, restoration requirements met.
*   **Common Issues**:
    *   **Locate Delays**: Notify supervisor, document area, do not proceed without locates.
    *   **Utility Conflicts**: Stop work, document, notify supervisor.
    *   **Documentation**: Be thorough, take extra photos, use consistent naming, back up daily.
